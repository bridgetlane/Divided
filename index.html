<h2>Divided</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Attempt to keep the continuously spawning spores divided.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The game should cause the player to concentrate and be frustrating.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Casual games.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Use the 'W' and 'S' keys to move the center spore up and down. When a small spore looks like it is about to cross the divide, be sure to hit it with the large spore you control to prevent it from crossing. This will save you from losing and having each side contaminated, but it will also cause more spores to spawn.
<br>System dynamics: You can stop spores from crossing the divide, but that will cause more spores to spawn.
<br>Core mechanic: You can move the large spore up and down.
</li>
<br>

</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Story:</strong>
There is no story.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Casual gamers.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
3 minutes.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Try to anticipate spore movements.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All image assets made by me.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I did not model this game or take the game framework from any existing game or Phaser example.
<br>I would also like to point out that I did not take any of this game from gamemechanicexplorer.com.
